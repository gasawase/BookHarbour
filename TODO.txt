----UPDATED-----

12/1/2023

- create buttons at the top to sort the books

----TODO----

- more efficient way of storing data (only initially store coverimage and file url then when modal clicked, gather the data then)
- go through and remove duplicates
- real-time updating the bookshelf
- tracking reading time
- marking and storing reviews
- marking and sorting by tags
- sorting by name and author and such
- be able to display the info as the correct xhtml instead of the html string it is right now
	that way we can link things correctly and display things like images
- be able to have a drop down with all of the tags that the user can auto select to prevent overwriting
	- also to have it search through the list to see if they're writing anything that is already there

----DONE----
- ability to read book
- adding tags to books


----FEATURES I'D LIKE----
- move original bookbinder parsing from kanna to swiftsoup
- change layout of library to just see the spine
- make a customizable bookshelf where you can have a list of your books and design your bookshelf

----KNOWN BUGS----

----NOTES----

The manifest stores all of the data such as where the different pictures, covers, and toc are
