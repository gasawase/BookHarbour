/// The controller layer in SwiftUI can be a bit abstract, as SwiftUI manages a lot of state and interaction handling for you. However, you can create separate classes or structures that act as an intermediary between your views and the data model (e.g., fetching data, sorting, filtering). These can be thought of as view models or controllers depending on their complexity and role.
/// Refactoring Steps:
    /// Extract Logic into Controllers: Identify any logic within your views that manages data or interacts heavily with the model layer (e.g., sorting and filtering logic) and extract this into separate controller classes.
    /// Controller for Sorting and Filtering: Create a BooksController that handles fetching, sorting, and filtering books. This controller will interact with Core Data to fetch and manipulate data as required.
    /// Use Environment Objects or State Objects for Controllers: Inject your controllers into your SwiftUI views using @EnvironmentObject or @ObservedObject/@StateObject to keep your views updated with the latest data.
